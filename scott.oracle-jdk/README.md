# Role Name

I needed a role that didn't rely on yum to install Oracle JDK. It's not pretty but sometimes I need multiple JAVA_HOMES. This role allows that. Additionally it can install the JCE, as well as set the alternatives, latest, and default symlinks.

Finally, it can set the entropy fix for running on virtualized hardware.

CRYPTO CHANGE!
The java_install_jce flag continues to set policy, however to use the new crypt.policy flag set the 'java_crypto_policy' variable also.

Leaving the java_crypto_policy variable undefined (and setting java_install_jce to true) will install the JCE files as normal. Setting the java_crypto_policy variable will not install the files and will set the java.security crypto.policy setting so the policy folders will be used instead.

Use of this role implies acceptance of Oracle's terms of service and licenses; Use of JCE and Cryptography imply acceptance and complete understanding of your cryptography rules and law governing use.

NOTE: This is just for RHEL, CentOS, EL. 

To install,

    sudo ansible-galaxy install scott.oracle-jdk

## Role Variables

Variables and defaults follow.

Install the Oracle JCE:

    java_install_jce: false

Set the Oracle Crypto Policy (also requires the 'java_install_jce' flag be true):

    java_crypto_policy: unlimited

Sets the entropy source, securerandom.source=file:/dev/./urandom

    java_entropy_fix: false

Sets the default install location for RHEL

    java_install_dir: /usr/java

Clean up after yourself?

    java_remove_download: yes

Pull the files from Oracle? Saying yes implies you have accepted the license agreement!

    java_download_from_oracle: yes

Where to locate the files on the local machines. Also where the files need to be if not downloaded. Set the 'java_download_from_oracle' flag if you have the correct files already placed.

    java_download_path: /usr/local/src

Which version of course. Look to the defaults for the dictionary of latest versions.

    java_version: 8u91

Set the default symlink? Also fires off the alternatives routine.

    java_set_as_default: true

Set the latest symlink?

    java_set_as_latest: true

Want to install 32 bit Java? Defaults to linux-x64

    java_architecture: linux-x586

## Dependencies

No dependencies on other roles.

IMPORTANT: Using this role implies that you have accepted the Oracle license agreement to download the Oracle JDK and JCE. If you don't agree, don't use this role please.

## Example Playbook

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      become: yes
      become_user: root
      vars:
        java_install_jce: yes
        java_entropy_fix: yes
        java_remove_download: yes
        java_download_from_oracle: yes
        java_version: 8u74
        java_architecture: linux-x64
        java_set_as_default: yes
        java_set_as_latest: yes
      roles:
        - role: scott.oracle-jdk

## Another example Playbook

This example show setting JCE by using the java.security file... and no files.

    - hosts: servers
      become: yes
      become_user: root
      vars:
        java_install_jce: yes
        java_crypto_policy: unlimited
        java_entropy_fix: yes
        java_remove_download: yes
        java_download_from_oracle: yes
      roles:
        - role: scott.oracle-jdk
